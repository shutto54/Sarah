If one would like to find the career strikeouts versus homeruns for great hitters within the baseball world, they can make a scatterplot to show the data found. One can do this using R code, like so. First they would need to load their libraries (Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2), then they may continue with the code.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#extracting data

query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,
sum(SO) AS career_SO FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID HAVING sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)

#visualizing data

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=sum(career_SO),y=sum(career_HR)))+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts v. Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
