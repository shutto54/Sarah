<p>If one would like to find the career strikeouts versus homeruns for great hitters within the baseball world, they can make a scatterplot to show the data found. One can do this using R code, like so. First they would need to load their libraries (Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2), then they may continue with the code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#extracting data

query&lt;-&quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,
sum(SO) AS career_SO FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID HAVING sum(HR)&gt;=400&quot;

result&lt;-sqldf(query)

#visualizing data

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=sum(career_SO),y=sum(career_HR)))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Career Strikeouts v. Homeruns for Great Hitters&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Career Strikeouts&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Career Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
